## Fine-Tuning DeiT-base on the MNIST dataset

In `deit_base_mnist.ipynb`, the DeiT-base model (<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/deit">link here</a>) is fine tuned on the MNIST dataset. 96% accuracy is achieved after 3 training epochs using the SGD optimizer and the OneCycle learning rate policy. Implemented in PyTorch.
